# Tag Graph 

## This renders a graph with physics in realtime, it is not lightweight, it may take quite a while before the graph will show up

This plugin does not run in stash, but instead runs in your browser

To view, go to `http://localhost:9999/plugin/tagGraph/assets/graph/`

## some graphs may have "super" nodes that users may want to omit you can do so by either providing a filter that matches all the tags you want to exclude or by adding the tags ID to the array in the config file
